                  great, easy to schedule with and extremely accommodating! They
                  are so helpful in trying to make sure all of your needs are
                  met and everything goes smoothly in addition to being so
                  responsive and supportive. I also have to mention how great
                  the women who answer the phones are! Everyone I’ve interacted
                  with at this practice has been so kind and helpful. I highly,

From our very first session I felt understood and supported in ways I hadn't experienced before. She was able to refine my diagnosis so my treatment plan could be more tailored to my specific needs, and she uncovered another diagnosis that had been missed by countless previous doctors. Shelley’s empathetic in her approach, listens attentively, and offers invaluable insights."`
